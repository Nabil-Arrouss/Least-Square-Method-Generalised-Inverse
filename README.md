# Least Squares Method

This section of the repository focuses on the Least Squares Method and the Generalised Inverse.
- Tests are available within the source codes 

## 1. LSM Approximation (`lsmapprox.m`)

Approximate values using the Least Squares Method for a polynomial of a specified order.

### Input Arguments:
- Order of polynomial `n`
- Nodes of approximation (in a vector)
- Vector of function values in nodes

### Output Argument(s):
- Coefficients of the polynomial


## 2. Generalised Inverse (`geninv.m`)

Calculate the generalised inverse of a given matrix.

### Input Argument:
- The matrix `A`

### Output Argument:
- The generalised inverse `A‚Å∫`
